# Reproducible_Figures_R
This repository contains all project files for my reproducible figures assignment (Project_1)

The main script (Homework.rmd) is where question 2 of the assigment can be located.

In the assignment, I will be using the Palmer Penguins dataset, specifically focussing on the penguin body mass data and flipper length data (along with the species and sex of the penguins). I clean and load the data before presenting the relationship between the two numerical variables on a scatter plot. Then, I carry out a correlation test to assess the strength of the association between the variables. Finally, I produce a figure displaying the results of the statistical test and discuss my findings.
